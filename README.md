# AI-Powered Terminal Assistant

## Overview

AI-Powered Terminal Assistant is a Python-based terminal assistant that helps users with smart shell command suggestions, auto-corrections, and command execution. It integrates **OpenAI GPT-4** for intelligent suggestions and corrections. In case the API is unavailable, the assistant also provides fallback fuzzy matching using Python's built-in libraries. The project is designed to run directly in your terminal, offering an efficient and interactive way to execute shell commands.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language used for backend logic.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For intelligent command suggestions and corrections.
- **subprocess module**: For executing shell commands.
- **difflib module**: For fuzzy matching of commands.
- **shlex module**: For safely splitting user input into shell commands.
- **Regex**: For pattern-based command corrections (e.g., fixing common flag mistakes).

### Set Up OpenAI API Key

Sign up at OpenAI and get your API key. Add the key in the `ai_terminal_assistant.py` file:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
Alternatively, you can set the API key as an environment variable for better security:

On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
Edit
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
On Windows:
bash
